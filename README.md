# How-to-make-custom-capes-but-better
This is a better version of Quendo's "tutorial"

1.Install MCP (the tutorial is going to be for MCP 910
2.Install optifine for that MCP version
3.Run the client and check it doesn't have bugs
4.Create a folder in the package "assets.minecraft"
5.Put your cape texture in that folder!
6.Create a class (mine is going to be "CapeController" and do something like this: public static boolean name = true; (you can make it fech the username or uuid and see if the user owns the cape and has it on but this is just a starting point))
7.Open the class optifine.CapeUtils
8.Go to the CapeUtils in this rep and copy ALL the code and replace the code with the code in the rep
9.Replace the file path and the <capeboolean> with the one you created
Run it!
